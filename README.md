**In this project I was tasked to Create a game in react as a capstone project.**

 **Rules of Memory game:**

-Pick a name of your choice for the game. Or leave blank.
-Turn over cards and try to match them to their respective partner by using memory.
-Every time you win you get 1 point that will show on top of the page in the navbar next to "score".
-Press the help/rules button at any time to get the rules of the game on the page if you forgot.
-By restarting or quitting you can restart the game with 0 score and a new username.
